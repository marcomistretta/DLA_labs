# Deep Learning Applications Labs

This repository contains the source code for the three laboratory assignments completed during the "Deep Learning Applications" course taught by Professor Andrew David Bagdanov ([@bagdanov](https://github.com/bagdanov) on Github). The labs cover a variety of topics related to deep learning, including convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning.

## Lab 1 - Convolutional Neural Networks

The first lab focuses on convolutional neural networks, specifically comparing residual and non-residual networks. The source code for this lab can be found in the `lab1/` directory.

## Lab 2 - Large Language Models

The second lab explores large language models using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The source code for this lab can be found in the `lab2/` directory.

## Lab 3 - Reinforcement Learning

The third and final lab covers reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q learning and PPO. The source code for this lab can be found in the `lab3/` directory.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed, as well as several deep learning libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory of the lab you wish to run. From there, you can run the code using the appropriate commands.
